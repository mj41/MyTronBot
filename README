Damien calls for perl programmers to participate in Google's AI Challenge.
Currently the best perl program ranks 176th, which I agree is too bad.

This is my attempt to improve the ranking for a perl based program.
I invite everybody to fork and submit patches with improved AI decision.

The competition ends on 2010-02-26.
